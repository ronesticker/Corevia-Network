# Corevia Network

**Corevia Network** is a Layer-1 blockchain infrastructure designed to power app-chains, rollups, and AI-native decentralized applications.

Corevia focuses on modular execution, integrated data availability, and native oracle support — enabling developers to build scalable, high-performance blockchain systems without reinventing core infrastructure.

> Corevia is not where applications run.  
> Corevia is where applications are built.
